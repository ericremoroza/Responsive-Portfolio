                My name is Eric Remoroza. I am currently a student at Georgia Tech, enrolled in the coding boot camp. I graduated from Berry
                College in May 2018 with a Bachelor of Science in Creative Technologies, which is an interdisciplinary field
                combining computation, design and art. In addition to my bachelor's degree, I also minored in business administration.
                I currently work part-time as a co-host on Airbnb.
            </p>
            <p>
                My hobbies include walking my dog, performing karaoke, video editing and traveling by air. After completing the coding boot
                camp, I aspire to work as a UX/UI developer at Delta Air Lines.
